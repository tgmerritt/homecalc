This is a home loan calculator.  It will reveal a more accurate analysis of the true value of home ownership.

Add a new loan, and fill out the values you've been given by your lender.  The calculator takes into account your tax situation and provides an estimated cost of ownership after tax adjustments.

The project will be live on Heroku - feel free to fork it and change it.

Uses MongoDB, Rails 3.2, Ruby 2, and Bootstrap
